In this repository there are two R script files, one of which uses the example 'Test input' and shows that the output produced matches the 'Expected output'. The second script reads from a plain text file, and currently this is located at "~/Downloads/test_input.txt". This can easily be adjusted if needed. The plain text file has a header named 'Input', similar to the test case. The files should load all necessary packages into the library.

The first function displayed is used to change the numbers into the corresponding text. The next stage cleans the inputted numbers, making sure that they satisfy the necessary conditions. It was assumed that a number would only be valid when displayed as a set of continuous digits, with only a space, line break, or full stop appearing next to the number. The numbers are transformed into word form, formatting is added to the string, and the final result will be displayed.
